# Deep Learning 

A collection of blog articles and code related to Deep Learning that I've curated. 

I regularly write about Python, Machine Learning, Freelancing, Productivity, and Self-Branding in my 
[Medium Blog](https://kurtispykes.medium.com). With a $5 a month commitment, you can unlock an 
unlimited access to stories on Medium. If you use my

my posts directly to your inbox whenever I publish. 

## Downloading the code

The simplest way to download the code is to clone the repository with `git clone`:
```
git clone https://github.com/kurtispykes/Deep-Learning.git
```
### The steps
1. `git clone <repo>`
2. `cd <repo>`
3. `pip install virtualenv` (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
4. `virtualenv venv` to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
5. `venv/bin/activate.bat` to enter the virtual environment
6. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements in the current environment
